# The Odin Project Curriculum by Mariope

Exercises from The Odin Project, only for learning purposes.

If you want to learn web development, visit [The Odin Project](http://www.theodinproject.com). 
They found the best free resources out there and grouped them into the courses listed below so you don't have to waste time doing it yourself. They've also created projects for you to build along the way so you can really learn the material and boost your portfolio.
The courses are designed to be completed in order, so start from the top and work your way down. The best part is, it's free!
